# Age Detection from Facial Features

## Overview
This project aims to create a robust algorithm for age detection from facial images. It leverages advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyze demographic attributes, with deep learning models discerning features such as wrinkles, facial structure, and skin texture. The model is trained on a diverse dataset to ensure accuracy and inclusivity across different ages, ethnicities, and conditions.

## Features
- Real-time age estimation with high precision.
- Trained on a diverse dataset for reduced bias and improved accuracy.
- Respects privacy and ethical standards in data handling.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch 1.7.1+
- OpenCV, PIL, and additional common data science libraries.

# Example of inference usage
preds, img = inference('path_to_image.png', test_transform, model, face_detection=True)
print(f'Predicted Age: {preds:.2f}')
